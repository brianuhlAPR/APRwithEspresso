                If you have some Scrum training under your belt, and you’ve been working with a team for a while now, but you’re facing challenges that you’re not sure how to handle, this is the next step for you.

                If things are working, kind of, but not as well as you’d hoped - or as obviously as management would like to see - the A-CSM workshop will give you knowledge and techniques to handle the complex challenges faced by Scrum teams and Scrum organizations. Drawing from our experience, as well as feedback from ScrumMasters we have trained, we have identified common issues facing Scrum users and address them in the course.
